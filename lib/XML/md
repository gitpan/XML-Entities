# NAME

XML::Entities - Decode strings with XML entities

# SYNOPSIS

    use XML::Entities;

    $a = "Tom &amp; Jerry &copy; Warner Bros&period;";
    $b = XML::Entities::decode('all', $a);
    $c = XML::Entities::numify('all', $a);
    # now $b is "Tom & Jerry Â© Warner Bros.
    # and $c is "Tom &#38; Jerry &#169; Warner Bros&#46;"

    # void context modifies the arguments
    XML::Entities::numify('all', $a);
    XML::Entities::decode('all', $a, $c);
    # Now $a, $b and $c all contain the decoded string

# DESCRIPTION

Based upon the HTML::Entities module by Gisle Aas

This module deals with decoding of strings with XML
character entities.  The module provides two functions:

- decode( $entity\_set, $string, ... )

This routine replaces XML entities from $entity\_set found in the
$string with the corresponding Unicode character. Unrecognized
entities are left alone.

The $entity\_set can either be a name of an entity set - the selection
of which can be obtained by XML::Entities::Data::names(), or "all" for
a union, or alternatively a hashref which maps entity names (without
leading &'s) to the corresponding Unicode characters (or strings).

If multiple strings are provided as argument they are each decoded
separately and the same number of strings are returned.

If called in void context the arguments are decoded in-place.

Note: If your version of `HTML::Parser` was built without Unicode support, then
`XML::Entities` uses a regular expression to do the decoding, which is slower.

- numify( $entity\_set, $string, ... )

This functions converts named XML entities to numeric XML entities. It is less
robust than the `decode` function in the sense that it doesn't capture
improperly terminated entities. It behaves like `decode` in treating parameters
and returning values.

## XML::Entities::Data

The list of entities is defined in the XML::Entities::Data module.
The list can be generated from the w3.org definition (or any other).
Check `perldoc XML::Entities::Data` for more details.
